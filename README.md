# Clustering---K-means-and-Linkage-Based-Clustering
## Overview
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for Lab 3 of the Machine Learning course, focusing on clustering techniques, specifically K-means and linkage-based clustering (Agglomerative Clustering). The notebook demonstrates the application of these clustering algorithms on images.

## Content
1. **Introduction**  
   An overview of clustering methods used in this lab, including K-means and Agglomerative Clustering.

2. **Preliminary Steps**  
   Loading necessary libraries and defining helper functions for image processing and plotting.

3. **K-means Clustering**  
   - Implementation of the K-means algorithm, both manually and using scikit-learn.
   - Segmenting images (Santa Claus image and Landscape image) based on color clustering.
   - Analyzing the inertia vs. number of clusters.

4. **Agglomerative Clustering**  
   - Applying Agglomerative Clustering to segment the Santa Claus image and Landscape image.
   - Visualizing the segmented images.
   - Creating a dendrogram to illustrate the clustering structure.

5. **Conclusion**  
   Summarizing the findings from the clustering results and answering specific questions about the methods used.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- scipy

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn scipy
